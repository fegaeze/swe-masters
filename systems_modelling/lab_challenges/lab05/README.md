# Lab 05

## ATM Money Withdrawal

We had our initial meeting on Tuesday, however we were not able to achieve anything great on that day because we spent 3/4 the entire session trying to get Papyrus to run. We eventually found a way by installing Eclipse, and adding it as a plugin. The remainder of the session was spent working on the example profile and model given in the slides to get a feel for what we should do. We decided on having another meeting.

We met again on Sunday evening to work on our labs project. Everyone had prepared and we had a really good discussion. Ihar moderated the discussion whilst Monika shared her screen and did the actual modeling.

For our UML diagram, we picked "User Story 1" for our ATM Money Withdrawal Objet diagram task in [lab 2 - 2.1.6](../lab02/README.md)
