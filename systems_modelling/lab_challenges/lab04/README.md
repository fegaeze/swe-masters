**Association between Game System & Player**: The association here shows that a game system can have many players. There's actually a hard limit of two. However, the players can only play on one game at a time.      
**Association between Game System & Board**: The association here shows that the system can have exactly one game board, and vice versa.      
**Association between Board, Playing Pit & Kalah**: Both the playing pits and the Kalah are a part of the Board. They cannot exist if the board does not exist.

## ATM Money Withdrawal Code Generation
Used the Class Diagram from Lab 03 [ATM Class Diagram](../../portfolios/monika/lab-notes/lab03/ATM_Lab03_class_all.png). <br>
Implemented class diagram:
 - in Umple. Source code [WithUmple](../../portfolios/monika/lab-notes/lab4/JavaWithUmple)
 - in Fulib. Source code [WithFulib](../../portfolios/monika/lab-notes/lab4/Javawithfulib)

Fulib is much better than Umple because we can generate gradle, test the code, run the same zipped program in IDE for testing, debug and other purposes. We can see both class and object diagrams at real time also.

## More Code Generation

We took the ATM Class Diagram for the task:

<img src="../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab04/atm-class.drawio.svg" alt="Code generation ATM class" width="500"/>

and [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/uml-class-diagram-tutorial/) as a UML-to-code tool.

**Observations**:

- It seems that bidirectional referential integrity is not supported by the software. No documentation about that was found. Integrity wasn't enforced by software.
- There're multiple settings related to attributes: multiplicity (1, 1..*, *, etc.), visibility (private, public, protected, etc.), types, default values, etc. There's a possibility to add getter and setters automatically.
- Our example doesn't use inheritance, so we didn't need it.
- Associations should be explicitely specified as attributes, then code generation works and connections can be visualized. If we start with drawing associations by hand, attributes aren't generated automatically. There's a way to specify cardinality (multiplicity), but it doesn't influence the code generation.
- There is a possibility to generate all necessary getters and setters, as well as constructors. It can support the fluent interface if a user defines all the necessary methods and output types manually.

**Artefacts**:
- [Class diagram](../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab04/more_code_generation/ATM.svg) from VP
- [Java source code](../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab04/more_code_generation/visual_paradigm_source) generated by VP from the diagram
- [VP project](../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab04/more_code_generation/ATM.vpp)

## Code Generation Discussion

**Tools under discussion**
* Fulib (FL)
* umple (UM)
* Visual Paradigm (VP)
* manual code generation      

**Criteria**
- Attributes handling; getters and setters
- Inheritance implementation
- Associations implementation; cardinalities
- Ease of use      

**Ranking**
Tool | Score, 0..4
-----|------------
Fulib | 3.5
umple | 3
Visual Paradigm | 3
manual code generation | 4      

**Some arguments**
- VP was a pleasant experience, but lists (collections) weren't identified automatically even the according syntax was used.
- Manual code generation had the only drawback — a user needs to write everything manually. However, it doesn't require proof-reading like all other code generation tools.
- UM was okay but we manually have to drag the class diagrams so it might not be that appropriate when we have the full pages of connected diagrams. Another point that i want to highlight is that i couldn't find operation method there.
- FL was super cool where we get to see both the class and object diagrams together at the same time. Also it lets us to generate gradle which is the coolest part of it. Only drawback of it is that, the language is a bit weird to understand and the broken English is zig-zagged in a way, and the user interface is too small to work on with. Seems only appropriate for larger desktops.

## Mancala Usecase Diagrams

High-level use case diagram      | <img src="../../portfolios/jessica/assets/lab04/mancala_high_level.png" alt="High-level use case diagram" height="400"/>
Very detailed use case diagram   | ![usecase_diagram.drawio__1_](/uploads/891bce5c517e1011d51e1f2efef451c4/usecase_diagram.drawio__1_.png)
&nbsp;

**Discussion**: 

The high-level diagram is suitable for understanding the basics of the system, but it does not provide details. In our case, our high-level use case diagram is not designed for the web based system. even if the high-level diagram illustrates the web version still not enough to kickstart the development process. On the other hand, we agreed that a use case diagram with a combination of detailed and high-level diagrams abstracts the software requirements and can be helpful in the early development process, such as requirements and architecture. However, only use case diagrams are not sufficient, and as referred to in the class discussion, more diagrams are always good and, in the longer term, save us from building the wrong product.

Fictional name | Tiit Taam
Job title | Board Games Reviewer on Youtube
Demographics | - 23 y.o.<br> - Estonian<br> - Engaged<br> - Has a Bsc in Computer Science
Goals and tasks | Every week, Tiit picks a board game from somewhere around the world, and gives a how-to-play guide to his audience. Based on a recent poll on his twitter account, his audience asks him to review Mancala. Tiit will have to learn the rules of Mancala, and play against experts in order to create a good review for his audience.
Environment | Tiit is a more than average computer user. He is connected to the internet through his building's WIFI. For outages, he uses a mobile hotspot. Tiit uses video editing software to make his videos.

**Discussion**:      
- Obviously, the high-level diagram is more readable and helps to understand the system for a particular situation. However, it doesn't show the full complexity of the interconnected systems and actors. A high-level view might be needed in the beginning, during the architecture desing. A more detailed picture is required at the implementation and maintenance phase, it displays points of possible failures more vividly and helps to grasp the full required functionality.
- Use case diagrams are pretty useful, as they abstract away from software. They highlight the interface between users and software. However, for the software development use case diagrams are not enough. Class or component diagrams are needed as well. It is always good to add even more diagrams, e.g. sequence, deployment, activity, etc. — but it does not seem to be realistic for a common project.

Fictional name | John Doe
Job title | Librarian at UT Library
Demographics | - 45 y.o.<br> - Married<br> - Father of three children<br> - Has a PhD in Humanitarian Sciences
Goals and tasks | He is a modest spending bank customer; has just repaid an apartment loan; doesn't want any loans anymore; doesn't have credit cards, but he has two debit cards, which he uses mostly for cashless transactions. However, from time to time he visits fairs and markets, where some sellers still can't provide a cashless payment alternative, so John is forced to withdraw money from ATMs.
Environment | John is PhD in Humanitarian Sciences, not Compuputer Science. He uses a computer at his workplace, but doesn't use much at home. He often forgets his PINs.
Quote | Not a technical person, but knows how to use simple software. Doesn't spend much.

Job title | Software Developer
Demographics | - 35 y.o.<br> - Married<br> - Mother of five<br> - Has a MS in Software Engineering
Goals and tasks | She spends a lot; has just bought an apartment; bought a car; has a credit card. As now she needs to repay two loans, she always goes overdraft. She doesn't use cashless payment and prefers to use cash wherever possible. So, she uses ATMs quite often.
Environment | Alice is an advanced user of computer systems; uses a password manager; never forgets her PINs.
Quote | Power user. Likes loans. Always takes another one.

**Discussion**
- In relation to user stories, personas focus more on presenting a user of a system, not so on the actual usage situations. Personas provide more personal details, while user stories describe steps taken by a user in a particular situation.
- We think that user stories support the software development better, as they provide particular usage situations and help to identify different points of contact with the system. Personas give more general overview of the whole class of users, which may give some hints on the functionality during the design phase. User stories are better suited for the development process. User stories may take inspiration from personas.
