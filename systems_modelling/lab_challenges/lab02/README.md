**Team Reflection**      
Since we had shared the labs exercises in the previous labs as follows: Jessica & Tahira on Mancala, Ihar on Mau Mau, Kenny & Monika on ATM withdrawal. We decided that for this labs we would stick to our parts of the exercises.  

For our labs period, we decided to do some object diagrams on the Mau Mau exercise since each person would be doing 5 diagrams each and Ihar would have to do 8. We picked one of Ihar's example and first outlined what the nouns in the examples were, and then proceeded to do the diagram. We quickly became confused after our first diagram because we were not sure if we were drawing a class diagram or an object diagram. For example, do we have a box that says "people", or do we have two boxes that represent each of the people in the example, that is "Alice" & "Bob".           

Well, after getting Vera, Ishaya and then Ulno on the call, we eventually understood that object diagrams are much more concrete than class diagrams in the sense that we need to outline each object. The diagram we first came up with for the example, is here: [Object Diagram Attempt](../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab02/practical_diagram.png). Tahira also found a ghost from Ulno's past to help clear up the issue :)... Access to it is here: [Old slides from Ulno](https://ulno.net/teaching/sa/12.pdf)

|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Example 1     | Alice has remained with the last card HA, but says nothing. After one more round, when her turn comes, she puts the last card on the playing deck and claims her win. However, the previous player notices that she hasn’t said “Mau”, when she remained with one card in hand, and refutes her win. Alice takes one more card from the drawing deck and stays in the game. The order of play is reversed now, because the last card on the deck was HA, and Ace reverses the playing order. 	| <img src="../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab02/mau-mau_1@2x.png" alt="Mau Mau example 1" width="1000"/> |
| Example 2     | Bob has multiple cards in hand. The previous player put DQ before. From diamonds, Bob has only 8, so, he plays with D8 on top of DQ. The next player, Alice, skips her turn, because any 8 forces a plyer to skip a turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	| <img src="../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab02/mau-mau_2@2x.png" alt="Mau Mau example 2" width="1000"/> |
| Example 3     | Alice plays with SJ. It doesn’t matter what card was before, because Jack can be played on top of any other card. Alice changes the suit to hearts. The next player, Bob, puts H9, because the value of a card played on Jack doesn’t matter, only a suit counts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	| <img src="../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab02/mau-mau_3@2x.png" alt="Mau Mau example 3" width="1000"/> |
| Example 4     | The previous player before Bob played with D7. Bob now has to draw two cards from the drawing deck, but the deck is empty. So, a free player takes the playing stack except the last card, shuffles it and turns over. Bob now can draw two cards and the game continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	| <img src="../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab02/mau-mau_4@2x.png" alt="Mau Mau example 4" width="1000"/> |
| Example 5     | Alice has to reply on S10, but has no any card of spades, neither she has any 10. Alice has to draw one more card from the drawing stack, and see if she can play with the new card. The new card is H10. Alice then plays with H10, and the turn goes to the next player.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	| <img src="../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab02/mau-mau_5@2x.png" alt="Mau Mau example 5" width="1000"/> |
| Example 6     | Bob answers with SK on top of S10. The next player, Alice, now has to take three cards from the drawing stack and skip the turn regardless of cards she has in hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	| <img src="../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab02/mau-mau_6@2x.png" alt="Mau Mau example 6" width="1000"/> |
| Example 7     | Alice plays with D9 on H9. The next player can play either with diamonds or 9 of any suit. Bob doesn’t have 9, but has D10 instead. He plays with D10, and the turn goes further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	| <img src="../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab02/mau-mau_7@2x.png" alt="Mau Mau example 7" width="1000"/> |
| Example 8     | Bob remained with the last card, DJ. So, he says “Mau-Mau” and waits for his last turn. When the turn comes, he puts DJ. As the players are keeping score of the game and the last winning card was Jack, all points of other players except Bob are doubled. The Bob wins the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                         	| <img src="../../portfolios/ihar/lab-notes/lab02/mau-mau_8@2x.png" alt="Mau Mau example 8" width="1000"/> |

## 2.1.3 Object Diagrams for Mancala
    
Just want to note that I was kinda influenced by the object diagram in Ulno's previous slides, so I did not come up with this on my own. The diagram just below is the initial state

| User Story 1 	| **Title: Merlin can get another turn after playing one round**<br>**Precondition** - The Mancala board is placed on the table between Merlin & Maggie. The Mancala board consists of fourteen pits - six playing pits plus one score pit (the kalah) per player. Both Merlin and Maggie have 3 pebbles in each of their playing pits to start the game.<br>1. Merlin takes the first turn, she picks up all three pebbles from the fourth pit on her side of the board. The fourth pit is now empty. She moves to the right.<br>2. Merlin drops one pebble into the fifth pit on her side of the board. The fifth pit now has four pebbles, and she has two pebbles left in her hand. She moves to the right.<br>3. Merlin drops one pebble into the sixth pit on her side of the board. The sixth pit now has four pebbles, and she has one pebble left in her hand. She moves to the right.<br>**Postcondition** - Merlin drops the only pebble left in her hand in her Kalah. She has no pebbles left in her hand. Her Kalah has one pebble in it now. She is eligible to play another round. To play another round, Merlin is allowed to pick from any of the pits that have pebbles in them.                                                                                                                                                                                            	| <img src="../../portfolios/jessica/assets/lab02/mancala_snd_turn.png" alt="Mancala example 1" width="1000"/> 	    |
| User Story 2 	| **Title: Merlin stalls to win the game**<br>**Precondition** - All of Merlin's six playing pits have at least one pebble in them. She also has a number of pebbles in her Kalah from the game play. Maggie has 6 pebbles in her fifth pit & 4 pebbles in her sixth pit. She also has a number of pebbles in her kalah from game play. It is Maggie's turn to play.<br>1. Maggie picks all 6 pebbles in her fifth pit. Moving right, she drops pebbles into each pit she comes across. She gets to her Kalah. She drops one in, but still has 4 pebbles in hand. She continues moving and drops off all the pebble's in Merlin's pits, stopping in the fourth pit. Her turn ends.<br>2. Merlin purposefully picks up the 4 pebbles from the 1st pit on her side of the board. Moving right, she drops pebbles into each pit she comes across. She drops the last pebble in the fifth pit on her side of the board.<br>3. Maggie picks up all 4 pebbles from her sixth pit. This is the only pit left with pebbles. She drops one into her Kalah, and continues till she drops all the pebbles in Merlin's pits stopping in the third pit. Her side of the board is now empty. The game ends.<br>**Precondition** - Merlin counts all the pebbles in her Kalah plus the pebbles in the 5 pits on her side of the board. She has more than half of the pebbles on the board. She wins the game. 	| <img src="../../portfolios/jessica/assets/lab02/mancala_stalling.png" alt="Mancala example 2" width="1000"/> 	    |
| User Story 3 	| **Title: Merlin makes an invalid move which the system rejects**<br>**Precondition** - Merlin has pebbles in 5 playing pits, and 9 pebbles in her kalah. Maggie has pebbles in 3 playing pits only, and 10 pebbles in her kalah.<br>1. Merlin has just finished a turn. The system recognizes that it is Maggie's turn to play.<br>2. Merlin clicks her fourth pit to go on another turn after finishing her turn.<br>3. The system marks the move as invalid and does not distribute the pebbles to the respective pits.<br>**Postcondition** - The system shows an error message to Merlin saying that it is not her turn to play. Maggie can play her turn successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	| <img src="../../portfolios/jessica/assets/lab02/mancala_invalid_move.png" alt="Mancala example 3" width="1000"/> 	|
| User Story 4 	| **Title: The system counts all pebbles to declare the winner**<br>**Precondition** - Merlin has 7 pebbles shared across 5 of her playing pits, and 15 pebbles in her Kalah. Maggie has two pebbles in her fifth & sixth pits, and 14 pebbles in her kalah. It is her turn to play.<br>1. Maggie picks up the pebble from her fifth pit, and moving right, places it in her sixth pit. Her turn ends.<br>2. Merlin picks up the pebbles in her 1st pit. They are two in number. Moving right, she drops it in her second and third pit respectively. Her turn ends<br>3. Maggie picks up the 2 pebbles from her sixth pit. She places one in her kalah, and moving right, places one in Merlin's first pit. Her side of the board is now empty, the game ends.<br>4. Merlin still has pebbles on her side of the board. The system adds all of them to her kalah.<br>5. The system redistributes each person's pebbles from their kalah to each of the pits to mirror the new game state. Each pit is filled with three pebbles.<br>**Postcondition** - Merlin's side of the board has been filled with three pebbles each, with 9 leftover in her kalah. This places Merlin as the winner as she has more than half of the pebbles on the board.                                                                                                                                             	| <img src="../../portfolios/jessica/assets/lab02/mancala_game_over.png" alt="Mancala example 4" width="1000"/> 	|
