# Lecture 14 Exercises:

## Summary, Open Discussion
In terms of course content, It would have been nice to have done the deployment diagrams. Those were skipped. I think the course did a good general introduction into modeling and the different types of modeling diagrams. Another thing that would have been nice is a more indepth teaching of the design patterns. It felt a bit rushed to be honest.

Also, the first couple of weeks were good in terms of discussions and feedback from the lecturers. However, there were a couple of times where it became hard to get appropriate feedback. I felt unsure a lot of times about decisions.

One suggestion would be to take up a project from the very beginning and introduce the diagrams at different stages to show real world use. I think there was a disconnect there for me.
