A sequence diagram describes how objects in your system interact to complete a specific task

## Sequence Diagram Discussion

**Pros:**      
- Sequence diagrams can be easily updated according to the changes within a system.
- Sequence diagrams are quite easy to generate.    

**Cons:**            
- Sequence diagrams can become complex when too many lifelines are involved in the system.  
- If the order of message sequence is changed, then incorrect results are produced.
&nbsp;

**Best For:**      
- Sequence diagrams are able to model concurrent systems
- A good tool to share knowledge simply without containing complex programming concepts. Gives a good overview of the behaviours and intricacies of the system whilst also showing the interaction between the system and external bodies.  

**Best Against:**            
- Can become too complex if it has too many lifelines and actors involved
- Real system development can be different from the given diagram. It will be useless in that case
