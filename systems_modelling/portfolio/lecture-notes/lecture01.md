# Lecture 01 Exercises

## Exercise 1 - Who Are You?
- **What do you expect from systems modelling?**      
I would like to learn how to break down and communicate software systems, with an emphasis on "communication".
&nbsp;

- **Which software architectures/modeling techniques have you already worked with?**     
I have no background in software architecture or modelling. I started this course last year, but I don't think I went far enough to really understand the concepts.
&nbsp;

- **Who are you, why are you studying in SE master?**      
I'm Chioma Nkem-Eze, a frontend developer at Quidax and SWE masters student at UT.       
I learnt how to code because I wanted to build exciting things. I haven't been able to do that so far. I'm hoping that the masters program would give me the chance to work on research teams as a SWE. I want to work on projects that are cutting edge. 
&nbsp;

- **What are your software development skills?**     
I'm a frontend developer. My core language right now is JavaScript, and some Typescript. I have done some python in the past, but not extensive.
&nbsp;

- **What are your weaknesses regarding software development?**     
Maybe because I was self-taught, but I feel like I lack the technical foundation I need. I find that I don't have deep knowledge, just enough to get by.    
&nbsp;

## Exercise 2 - Who is Software Architecture?
**Search 1-2 definitions and examples for Software Architectures?**      
- According to wikipedia, "Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems."  
- Software architecture is, simply, the organization of a system. This organization includes all components, how they interact with each other, the environment in which they operate, and the principles used to design the software.      
- Examples of Software Architecture: Monolithic Architecture, Microservices etc

**Assess your findings and say what is good about the definition and what is bad about this definition**    
When I read the definitions above, I get a very vague understanding of what software archutecture is. Questions that flow through my minds are, what are these fundamental structures of a software system? Does this describe the code? or is this a breakdown of requirements. In my bid to understand, I came across a document by Martin Fowler titled "Who needs an Architect?". In this document, Ralph Johnson defines software architecture as:       
```
In most successful software projects, the expert developers working on that project have a shared understanding of the design. This shared understanding is called ‘architecture.’ This understanding includes how the system is divided into components and how the components interact through interfaces. These components are usually composed of smaller components, but the architecture only includes the components and interfaces that are understood by all the developers.
```      
The definition above gives me some answers to my questions. These answers are:
- There needs to be clear understanding of the system or product in question. I'm guessing this understanding comes from expert domain knowledge of the system
- Software architecture exists for reference and communication
- Software architecture only specifies components & interactions that are relevant to the quality attributes needed to be achieved
- There is no one playbook for all systems. The context of the system matters. That being said, there are reusable architecture patterns that address certain concerns

### Exercise 3 -  
- **Which types of diagrams are mentioned in the talk?**      
The shopping list of technologies, Boxes & no lines diagrams, The functional view, The airline route map, Generically true, The logical view, Homeless old C# Object (HOCO), Choose your own adventure      

- **What is the standard for modeling software mentioned in the movie?**      
UML is the one true standard for describing software.   

- **Why is nobody using it?**      
People think UML is too complex and low level. There is also a problem with no one on the team knowing it. Also, people equate being agile to mean that they don't need uml.       

- **What is the model-code gap and what is the problem with it?**      
Concepts in code are different from the concepts in the abstractions

- **What do you personally think about layers for modeling software?**      


- **How do you think about Systems Modeling after watching this movie?**      


- **Anything else remarkable from the movie, we should share/discuss?**
