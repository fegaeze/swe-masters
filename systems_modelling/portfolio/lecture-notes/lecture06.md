# Lecture 06 Exercises

## The Role of Systems Modeling
- The customer or product owner      
    Some models such as user stories are quite good for communicating with the product owner. These initial models help software architects refine requirements that the product owner might have. That way, all stakeholders are on the same page.
- The initial developer      
    Models are very important for the initial developer. It might help with setup through code generation, and it gives them an accurate picture of how to proceed with the actual implementation.
- The maintaining developer     
    Especially in large systems, it is quite tedious to go through the codebase and understand what the moving parts are. With models, we can already see a snapshot of components that exist, as well as relationship, behaviour etc. This makes the job easy for the maintaining developer who is only interested in improving one small part of the overall system.

Most people in the lecture chose most of what I chose. The other popular choices were Requirement Engineer and Software Architect. I don't agree with this picks because I believe that these roles are mostly involved with modeling. Except for reference purposes to help in their work, I don't see how they might benefit from the models themselves.

## Component Diagram Discussion

**Pros:**      
- Very useful in the implementation phase for developers
- Component diagrams show more complex and varied connections than most class diagrams can      

**Cons:**            
- Too many interfaces make systems hard to understand.    
- It is not useful for designing of some software like web page, application etc.
&nbsp;

**Best For:**      
- Very easy to understand and flexible in implementation (for source version control, release version or even database)
- Great for reusability      

**Best Against:**            
- Due to its flexibility and abstraction level, it could become hard to understand abstraction and the overall system
