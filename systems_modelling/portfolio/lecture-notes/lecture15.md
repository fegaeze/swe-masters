# Lecture 15

## Final project review

For this lecture, we watched a video of everyone's final project. I personally feel like everyone did great. Here are a couple of thoughts on each team's presentation:      

- **Team 1_6_13_11**: The frontend app for this team showed the full functionality of the system which was good because it was easy to demo and showed the amount of effort that went into development as doing a GUI for every part was not required. The idea of everyone doing the modelling; whilst it's good to give everyone hands-on experience, the main idea of modelling it to come up with a vision. Having some sort of team collaboration would have been good.

- **Team 3_8_12_11**: I liked the video presentation for this team. It was nice seeing all the students together in the call. I also think that their extra feature (the QR code) was a very nice touch. Their architecture diagrams was actually quite impressive to be honest. Showed good understanding of concepts taught in the course. 


- **Team 4_7_9**: The application presented was pretty good in terms of design. Out of the teams, this team's project was developed in such away that it would be great to extend.


**My favorite team is Team 3_8_12_11**: They did a great job with the architecture parts. The amount of work put into the project was clear.
