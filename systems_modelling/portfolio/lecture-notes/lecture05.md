- **What is meta modeling, why is it interesting in the context of this class?**
    Meta modeling in simple terms is creating a model that can be used to create other models. The focus really is creating a model that describes concepts in certain domains. These descriptions (a model) can then be used to accurate define models for problems in that domain      

- **What are typical application domains for meta modeling (in general and examples)?**
    According to a paper, "Metamodeling: Some Application Areas in Information Systems" by Dimitris Karagiannis et al, metamodels are utilized to solve two fundamental types of tasks. They are: “create” and “compose”.      
    
    Create tasks involved the generation of new metamodels. They are highly domain specific as the created meta-model has to provide language constructs that generated models would use. E.g. regulatory compliance, business process management.      

    Compose tasks denotes the combination of already existing metamodels in order to create one single new metamodel for a specific purpose. The purpose for this is usually to achieve semantic interoperability.        

- **How and for what could you see yourself using meta modeling?**
    For large projects. Meta modeling would be great to provide conceptual structure for all other generated models      

- **What would be arguments against using meta modeling or potential critique or pitfalls?**
    I have no critiques for meta modeling.
