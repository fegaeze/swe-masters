# Lecture 12 Exercises

### Guest lecture with Marlon Dumas
Before this lecture, there was a lot of hype as Marlon is quite an experienced and popular researcher in the area of business process modelling. It was good to finally get some understanding of the topic and what it relates to. 

I think this topic is very relevant to enterprise engineers. A lot of developers, me included are too focused on the code sometimes that it becomes hard to connect with the business. At work, I have had issues where it the engineering team is in a silo. It's churning out code that does not actually work.
