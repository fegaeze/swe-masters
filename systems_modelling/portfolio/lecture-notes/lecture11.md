# Lecture 11 Exercises

### Guest lecture with Alex Lovell-Troy

Having worked as a software developer for some number of years, I'm at the point where it's like "What next?". I find that I'm not really one for a managerial role as my favorite part of the job is discovering and implementing challenging stuff. 

I agree that "years of experience" is not a good indicatior for career progression as I have personally seen people with lower years of experience fare better at a job.

Right now, I think I'm more of an "implementer". Moving up would depend on the mindset I guess?
