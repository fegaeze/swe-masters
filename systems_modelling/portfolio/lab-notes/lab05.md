# Lab 05

**Reflections:**       
This session was quite frustrating. We had to do our tasks, but had a problem with getting Papyrus to work on any of our systems. We spent 3/4 of the session looking for a way to make it work. I eventually was able to get it to work as a plugin on the Eclipse IDE. The discussions after that was also not really great as we were already exhausted from finding a solution, and it was already close to the end of labs. We had another session though, where we were able to get our tasks finished.

**Contributions:**  Helped find a solution to the problem we had in installing Papyrus. Then shared my screen to work on the model as everyone else could not get Papyrus on their system in time. We had just little time left to the end of labs.
