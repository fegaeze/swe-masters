# Lab 06

**Reflections:**       
During this session, the tasks were a bit overwhelming and had to do with code generation which most of us still need not have concrete understanding. We immediately shared the tasks. I had to work on Mancala code generation, use case diagrams and personas with Tahira. We spent the labs reviewing our past work. Some of us, myself included had some questions on the last tasks, and wanted the entire group to review. We had good discussions.

Ishaya came in, and advised that we need to pick up the page because we were lagging behind. He said that the best strategy is to do work on cureent tasks during the labs period. Somthing that has not happened as often as I would like is the instructors dropping by. It almost feels like we're on our own.

**Association between Game System & Player**: The association here shows that a game system can have many players. There's actually a hard limit of two. However, the players can only play on one game at a time.      
**Association between Game System & Board**: The association here shows that the system can have exactly one game board, and vice versa.      
**Association between Board, Playing Pit & Kalah**: Both the playing pits and the Kalah are a part of the Board. They cannot exist if the board does not exist.
