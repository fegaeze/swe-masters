# Lab 10 - 15 (Course Project)

During Lab 10, our team did the event storming activity, and then did the first project meeting to discuss roles, distribution of tasks and next steps. Due to previous experience and the need to move fast, I volunteered to work as a frontend developer on the team. We settled on separating the backend and frontend. The frontend development team settled on React JS as the framework of choice for development as everyone was quite knowledgeable about it. An overview of tasks I completed for the project include: 

- **Wireframing**:      
    The task was to take the user stories that were defined during the event storming activity and create wireframes of them so that the frontend team could finalize with the architecture owner, product owner and backend team on the vision for the application. This activity took place during the first week of the project work. For the wireframes, I worked on: [the login flow for customers and admin](https://balsamiq.cloud/sf3rjup/pwx9xlp/r2278), [dashboard view](https://balsamiq.cloud/sf3rjup/pwx9xlp/r3677), [internal transfer flow](https://balsamiq.cloud/sf3rjup/pwx9xlp/r0B6B), [bank charges flow for admin](https://balsamiq.cloud/sf3rjup/pwx9xlp/rAE82), [account creation flow for admin](https://balsamiq.cloud/sf3rjup/pwx9xlp/r93BE) and wireframes for a successful or failed action. We used balsamiq for the design, which was quite helpful to communicate over notes.

- **Development**:
    For the development, we settled on implementing customer log in, p2p transaction, dashboard overview, and transaction history based on the requirements of the project. The tasks I worked on included: [user can login screen](https://github.com/Sysmod-2021/bankappfrontend/pull/5), [ui view for dashboard with tab implementation](https://github.com/Sysmod-2021/bankappfrontend/pull/6), [p2p transfer flow with success and failed states](https://github.com/Sysmod-2021/bankappfrontend/pull/18), [user can see account overview functionality](https://github.com/Sysmod-2021/bankappfrontend/pull/19), [login-logout functionality](https://github.com/Sysmod-2021/bankappfrontend/pull/20), [and a simple cors fix](https://github.com/Sysmod-2021/bankappfrontend/pull/21). The development tasks took place over the course of two weeks with the last week left for bug fixing and extra additions.
