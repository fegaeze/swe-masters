# Lab 07

**Reflections:**       
During this session, we decided that it was best to share the tasks into three. Ihar seemed excited to do the GUI, so he went with that. I chose to work on wireframes because i thought it would be very interesting to work on. Kenny & Monica decided to work on the sequence diagrams together. After sharing the tasks, we all worked individually to finish up our portfolios.

Working on the wireframes was quite interesting. I find that I think better when I have visual cues, so it was nice to work through the flow and imagine if it was a real system. One thing though, it became really tedious easily as every little user action or game detail had to be captured. 

## Lab exercises
### Mancala Wireframes
The wireframe prototypes below cover a set of scenarios defined in earlier lab exercises. A brief summary includes:
- User plays another turn if they land on their kalah
- Three rounds of game play 
- Waiting for second player in game lobby
- Game over situation with a player win

I have also included comments on balsamiq to guide through the process...
