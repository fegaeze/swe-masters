## Notes

### Session 1

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture01.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab01.md)
- Reflections:      
  I like the idea of the portfolio because it gets me engaging with the materials over and over again, and gets me to think. The interactive style of the class also means that I am not dozing off during the lecture. However, I feel like this lecture was rushed. If not that I read the chapter on story-driven modeling beforehand, I might have had a hard time connecting the dots.

### Session 2

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture02.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab02.md)
- Reflections:  
  This was a very interesting lecture. I especially liked the recap at the beginning as it provided more context on the topic "Software Architecture" and answered some questions that I had. The discussion warmup was a bit difficult to follow. Getting all the teammates in, and then making decisions on the best diagrams is quite hard in the allotted time especially if we're also trying to draw the diagrams within the time frame. I find that I really do well when I think through the diagrams after the class.

### Session 3

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture03.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab03.md)
- Reflections:  
  Lecture was engaging, and easy to follow. I understand that the code-along cannot be interactive if we're to finish in time, but I would have really liked it to be. I'm quite new to OOP, and would have loved to ask questions about the bi-directional association whilst it was being coded live. Having the lecturer as well as my coursemates explain it would have been very helpful.

### Session 4

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture04.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab04.md)
- Reflections:
  The walkthrough of the class diagram was interesting. There was a lot that Ulno pointed out about the diagram that I wasn't able to catch. I would really like to have more of this. I have been feeling a bit demotivated though. I find that the topics are a bit too abstract and I am constantly left to guess if I am indeed getting things right. I also am not able to connect the topics learned with the real world.

### Session 5

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture05.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab05.md)
- Reflections:  
  I really really liked this class. Concrete discussion of metamodeling. The Q&A session was also very informative.

### Session 6

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture06.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab06.md)
- Reflections:  
  Lecture was okay. Started doing a beginner course in object-oriented design to catch up with the cooncepts in the class.  This was a good decision as I understand better what was thought in this course, and I am a bit more confident in modelling decisions. I plan to continue going back and forth between the two resources. 

  Also played around with code generation. It's awesome how you can generate code with just scenarios. 

### Session 7

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture07.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab07.md)
- Reflections:  
  Lecture was okay. I especially enjoyed the class on gui as it was a relatable subject. 

### Session 8

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture08.md)
- There was no labs!!! Spent the time on previous portfolio tasks
- Reflections:  
  This topic was actually very interesting to me. I intend to take the embedded specialization, and whilst reviewing the topics, came across model-checking. It was good to get an introduction into what it is.

### Session 9

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture09.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab09.md)

### Session 10

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture10.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab10-15.md)
- Reflections:
  The event storming session in the group wasn't as fun as the one in class. Everyone just kept adding tasks to the board in silence. Anyways we used it as a foundation of our user stories. Also, not excited about the large group for the project. I am a bit woriied about the outcome. In our first meeting, we still had no clarity on next steps. One of the first tasks on the group was to flesh out a user story based on the event storming activity.  

### Session 11

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture11.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab10-15.md)
- Reflections:  
  The lecture was good. Did a lot of reflection on my career and where I might want to go from here. Got some leeway during the labs, it still feels very disjointed though. Started the wireframes task.

### Session 12

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture12.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab10-15.md)
- Reflections:  
  Did meeting with project team, and outlined progress on frontend team.       
  Finalized with architecture owner on wireframes task. The entire team decided on doing a subset of the wireframes for the project. Was a bit disappointed.      
  Felt the need to move faster than backend so started work on the setup of the react app as well as the dashboard view.

### Session 13

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture13.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab10-15.md)
- Reflections:  
  Made some good progress on the frontend. Kept in touch with teammates to see how they are faring. Worked on the transfer functionality as well as gelped Armin debug his code. Did some back and forth with backend on some bug fixes that needed to happen.

### Session 14

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture14.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab10-15.md)
- Reflections:  
  Most functionality was kind of done. Completed all user stories that I had assigned to myself. Also helped Dami out with setup and code debug over pair programming.

### Session 15

- Lecture notes are [here](lecture-notes/lecture15.md)
- Lab notes with link to group work are [here](lab-notes/lab10-15.md)
- Reflections:  
  It's finally the end of the course. Felt a bit teary lol.
